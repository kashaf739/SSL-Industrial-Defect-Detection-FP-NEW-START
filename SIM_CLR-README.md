# SimCLR Model (Advanced/ultra efficient) for Anomaly Detection in MVTec AD Dataset

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) model as part of a Master's level research project comparing different learning approaches for anomaly detection tasks. The research aims to demonstrate that while self-supervised learning models may consume more computational power than supervised learning models, selfsupervised learning models like SimCLR can be more efficient and less time-consuming while maintaining or improving performance.

The project focuses on industrial anomaly detection using the MVTec AD dataset, comparing a CNN-based self-supervised learning approach with the SimCLR selfsupervised learning framework. This README specifically documents the SimCLR implementation and its evaluation results.

## Model Architecture

### SimCLR Framework
SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) is a self-supervised learning approach that learns representations by contrasting positive pairs (augmented views of the same image) against negative pairs (different images).

### Architecture Details
- **Backbone Network**: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Projection Head**: Multi-layer perceptron with batch normalization
  - Input: 2048 features (from ResNet50)
  - Hidden layers: 1024 → 512 units with ReLU activation
  - Output: 256-dimensional feature vectors
- **Loss Function**: NT-Xent (Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy Loss)
- **Temperature Parameter**: 0.1 (controls the concentration of the distribution)

### Advanced Techniques Implemented
1. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Maintains a moving average of model weights for stability
2. **MixUp and CutMix**: Advanced data augmentation techniques
3. **Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts**: Learning rate scheduling for better convergence
4. **Mixed Precision Training**: Uses FP16 for faster computation with minimal accuracy loss
5. **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients (max norm = 1.0)

## Evaluation Methodology

### Feature Extraction
Two types of features were extracted for evaluation:
1. **Encoder Features (h)**: Direct output from ResNet50 backbone (2048 dimensions)
2. **Projected Features (z)**: Output from the projection head (256 dimensions)

### Anomaly Detection Methods
Three different methods were used to compute anomaly scores:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Computes distance to k nearest neighbors in normal feature space
   - Uses cosine distance metric
   - k=5 (or fewer if insufficient samples)

2. **Mahalanobis Distance**:
   - Measures distance from sample to distribution of normal features
   - Computed as: √((x - μ)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (x - μ))
   - Where μ is mean and Σ is covariance matrix of normal features

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Computes cosine similarity to normal centroid
   - Converted to distance: 1 - cosine_similarity

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Average Precision**: Area under the precision-recall curve
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of true/false positives/negatives

### Additional Analyses
1. **t-SNE Visualizations**: 2D projections of feature spaces to visualize separability
2. **Clustering Analysis**: K-means clustering with silhouette scores
3. **Training Progression**: Performance tracking across epochs

## Results

### Key Findings
1. **Projected Features Outperform Encoder Features**: The projected features consistently achieved higher F1-scores, especially with Mahalanobis distance, reaching up to 0.9989.

2. **Mahalanobis Distance is Most Effective**: This method consistently outperformed others, particularly for projected features, with near-perfect results in epochs 1, 3, and 4.

3. **Early Convergence**: The model achieved excellent performance by epoch 3, with F1-scores exceeding 95% for both encoder and projected features.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: Despite using a large backbone (ResNet50), the model achieved high performance with relatively short training times (22-25 minutes per epoch).

5. **Robustness**: The model maintained high performance across different anomaly detection methods, demonstrating the robustness of the learned representations.

## Comparison with CNN (Self-Supervised Learning)

While this implementation focuses on the SimCLR model, the research project includes comparison with a CNN-based self-supervised learning approach. Key insights from the comparison:

### Computational Efficiency
- **SimCLR**: Requires significant computational resources during training but achieves excellent performance with fewer epochs
- **CNN**: May require less computational power per epoch but typically needs more epochs to achieve comparable results

### Training Time
- **SimCLR**: Reaches optimal performance in just 4 epochs (approximately 1.5-2 hours total)
- **CNN**: Often requires more extensive training to achieve similar anomaly detection capabilities

### Performance
- **SimCLR**: Achieves near-perfect F1-scores (0.9989) on the MVTec AD dataset
- **CNN**: Typically requires more labeled data and careful tuning to achieve similar results

### Data Efficiency
- **SimCLR**: Learns effective representations from normal samples only
- **CNN**: Usually requires both normal and anomalous samples for supervised training

These results support the research hypothesis that selfsupervised learning models can be more efficient and effective than supervised approaches for anomaly detection tasks.
