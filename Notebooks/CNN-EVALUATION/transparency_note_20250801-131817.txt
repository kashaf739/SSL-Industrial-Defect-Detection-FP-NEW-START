**IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY NOTE:**

The model was trained and evaluated on the full dataset due to the limited availability of labeled data. 
As such, the performance metrics represent the model's ability to fit the training data rather than its generalization capacity. 
Future work should evaluate on a held-out test set to better assess generalization.
