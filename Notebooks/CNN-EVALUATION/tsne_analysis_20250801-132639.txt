**t-SNE Analysis Summary:**

The t-SNE visualizations show how the CNN model has learned to represent different categories and defect statuses in its feature space.

Key observations:
1. **Category Separation**: In the category plot, we expect to see distinct clusters for each object type (bottle, capsule, etc.).
   - Well-separated clusters indicate the model has learned distinctive features for each category.
   - Overlapping clusters suggest similarities between certain object types.

2. **Defect Separation**: In the defect plot, we look for separation between good (green) and defective (red) samples.
   - Clear separation indicates the model has learned to distinguish defects from normal samples.
   - Overlapping points suggest the model struggles with certain defect types.

3. **Category-Specific Defect Patterns**: The combined plot shows how defects manifest within each category.
   - Some categories may show clear defect separation (e.g., bottle with contamination)
   - Others may have more subtle defect patterns (e.g., texture defects in carpet)

4. **Feature Space Quality**: 
   - Tight clusters within categories indicate consistent feature extraction.
   - Outliers might represent challenging samples or mislabeled data.

Note: t-SNE is a visualization technique and doesn't directly reflect model accuracy. 
The plots show the relative positioning of samples in the learned feature space.
