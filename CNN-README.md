# Industrial Anomaly Detection Using Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Networks

## 1. Introduction and Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of automated quality control in industrial manufacturing through the development of a sophisticated deep learning system. We implemented a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of simultaneously performing two essential functions: object category classification and defect detection. The system processes images of manufactured products to identify what type of object is being examined (e.g., bottle, capsule, screw) and simultaneously determines whether the object exhibits any manufacturing defects.

Our approach leverages the MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec AD) dataset, which provides a comprehensive collection of real-world industrial images spanning 15 different object categories. The project's novelty lies in its dual-task architecture, which efficiently shares feature representations between classification and detection tasks, resulting in a computationally efficient yet highly accurate system.

## 2. Dataset Description

### 2.1 MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset

The MVTec AD dataset serves as the foundation for our research. This publicly available benchmark dataset contains 5,354 high-resolution color images across 15 distinct industrial object categories:

- **Object Categories**: bottle, cable, capsule, carpet, grid, leather, metal nut, pill, screw, tile, toothbrush, transistor, wood, zipper, hazelnut

### 2.2 Dataset Structure and Characteristics

The dataset follows a specific structure designed for anomaly detection tasks:

```
mvtec_ad/
├── [category_name]/
│   ├── train/
│   │   └── good/          # Only defect-free images
│   └── test/
│       ├── good/          # Defect-free test images
│       ├── [defect_type_1]/ # Defective images
│       └── [defect_type_2]/ # Defective images
```

Key characteristics include:
- **Training Set**: Exclusively contains defect-free ("good") samples
- **Test Set**: Contains both defect-free and defective images with pixel-level annotations
- **Defect Types**: Various manufacturing imperfections including scratches, cracks, contamination, structural anomalies, and texture irregularities
- **Challenge**: Defects are often subtle and difficult to distinguish from normal manufacturing variations

### 2.3 Dataset Challenges

The dataset presents several significant challenges:
1. **Limited Defective Samples**: The training set contains only defect-free examples, requiring the model to learn a "normal" representation and identify deviations
2. **High Variability**: Defects manifest differently across categories (e.g., structural defects in screws vs. texture defects in carpets)
3. **Subtle Anomalies**: Many defects are barely perceptible to the human eye, requiring fine-grained feature extraction
4. **Category-Specific Defects**: Each object type exhibits unique defect patterns, necessitating category-specific learning

## 3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### 3.1 Data Organization and Labeling

Our first step involved systematically organizing the dataset and establishing a labeling framework:

```python
# Prepare dataset
image_paths = []
category_labels = []
defect_labels = []

for category in categories:
    # Process training data (all defect-free)
    train_good_dir = os.path.join(cat_dir, "train", "good")
    for img_name in os.listdir(train_good_dir):
        image_paths.append(os.path.join(train_good_dir, img_name))
        category_labels.append(category)
        defect_labels.append("good")
    
    # Process test data (both good and defective)
    test_dir = os.path.join(cat_dir, "test")
    for defect_type in os.listdir(test_dir):
        defect_dir = os.path.join(test_dir, defect_type)
        for img_name in os.listdir(defect_dir):
            image_paths.append(os.path.join(defect_dir, img_name))
            category_labels.append(category)
            defect_labels.append("good" if defect_type == "good" else "defective")
```

### 3.2 Label Encoding

We transformed categorical labels into numerical representations suitable for neural network training:

```python
# Encode labels
category_encoder = LabelEncoder()
defect_encoder = LabelEncoder()

category_labels_encoded = category_encoder.fit_transform(category_labels)
defect_labels_encoded = defect_encoder.fit_transform(defect_labels)
```

This encoding process:
- Converts 15 category names into integers (0-14)
- Transforms defect status into binary values (0: good, 1: defective)
- Preserves label relationships for later interpretation

### 3.3 Data Splitting Strategy

We implemented a stratified sampling approach to ensure balanced representation across categories:

```python
# Split data with stratification
X_train, X_val, y_cat_train, y_cat_val, y_def_train, y_def_val = train_test_split(
    image_paths,
    category_labels_encoded,
    defect_labels_encoded,
    test_size=0.2,
    stratify=category_labels_encoded,
    random_state=42
)
```

This strategy:
- Maintains proportional representation of all categories in both training and validation sets
- Prevents category imbalance issues
- Uses a fixed random seed for reproducibility

### 3.4 Image Preprocessing Pipeline

Our preprocessing pipeline standardizes input images and applies data augmentation:

```python
def load_and_preprocess(image_path, cat_label, def_label):
    img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    img = tf.image.decode_png(img, channels=3)
    img = tf.image.resize(img, [224, 224])  # Standardize input size
    img = tf.cast(img, tf.float32) / 255.0  # Normalize to [0,1]
    
    # Data Augmentation
    img = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(img)      # Horizontal flip
    img = tf.image.random_brightness(img, max_delta=0.2)  # Brightness adjustment
    img = tf.image.random_contrast(img, lower=0.8, upper=1.2)  # Contrast adjustment
    
    return img, {"category": cat_label, "defect": def_label}
```

Key preprocessing steps include:
- **Resizing**: Standardizes all images to 224×224 pixels
- **Normalization**: Scales pixel values to [0,1] range for stable training
- **Augmentation**: Applies random transformations to improve generalization:
  - Horizontal flipping (50% probability)
  - Brightness adjustment (±20%)
  - Contrast adjustment (±20%)

### 3.5 Data Pipeline Optimization

We created efficient TensorFlow datasets for high-performance training:

```python
# Create TensorFlow datasets
train_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_train, y_cat_train, y_def_train))
train_ds = train_ds.map(load_and_preprocess, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
train_ds = train_ds.shuffle(1000).batch(BATCH_SIZE).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
```

This pipeline:
- Utilizes parallel processing for efficient data loading
- Implements shuffling to prevent order-dependent learning
- Uses prefetching to overlap data preprocessing and model execution
- Batches data for optimized GPU utilization

## 4. Model Architecture and Design

### 4.1 Multi-Task Learning Framework

Our model architecture employs a multi-task learning approach, where a single neural network simultaneously performs two related tasks: object classification and defect detection. This design offers several advantages:

- **Parameter Efficiency**: Shared feature extraction reduces overall model complexity
- **Regularization Effect**: Joint training acts as implicit regularization
- **Representation Learning**: Shared features capture both category-specific and defect-relevant information
- **Computational Efficiency**: Single inference pass for multiple outputs

### 4.2 Network Architecture

The model consists of a shared convolutional backbone with two task-specific heads:

```
Input (224×224×3)
│
├── Convolutional Block 1
│   ├── Conv2D(32 filters, 3×3, ReLU activation)
│   └── MaxPooling2D(2×2)
│
├── Convolutional Block 2
│   ├── Conv2D(64 filters, 3×3, ReLU activation)
│   └── MaxPooling2D(2×2)
│
├── Convolutional Block 3
│   ├── Conv2D(128 filters, 3×3, ReLU activation)
│   └── MaxPooling2D(2×2)
│
├── Convolutional Block 4
│   ├── Conv2D(256 filters, 3×3, ReLU activation)
│   └── MaxPooling2D(2×2)
│
├── Global Average Pooling
│
├── Shared Dense Layers
│   ├── Dense(512 units, ReLU activation)
│   └── Dropout(0.5)
│
├── Category Classification Head
│   ├── Dense(256 units, ReLU activation)
│   ├── Dropout(0.3)
│   └── Dense(15 units, softmax activation)
│
└── Defect Detection Head
    ├── Dense(128 units, ReLU activation)
    ├── Dropout(0.3)
    └── Dense(1 unit, sigmoid activation)
```

### 4.3 Architectural Components

#### 4.3.1 Convolutional Backbone

The backbone consists of four convolutional blocks with the following characteristics:
- **Progressive Feature Extraction**: Filter count increases from 32 to 256 to capture hierarchical features
- **Spatial Reduction**: Max pooling layers progressively reduce spatial dimensions (224→14 pixels)
- **Non-linearity**: ReLU activation introduces non-linear transformations
- **Padding**: 'Same' padding preserves spatial dimensions after convolution

#### 4.3.2 Global Average Pooling

We replaced traditional flattening with Global Average Pooling (GAP):
- **Spatial Invariance**: Reduces spatial information to channel-wise statistics
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Eliminates dense connections between convolutional and dense layers
- **Regularization**: Reduces overfitting risk by decreasing parameter count

#### 4.3.3 Task-Specific Heads

Each task has a dedicated prediction head:
- **Category Head**: 15-unit softmax layer for multi-class classification
- **Defect Head**: Single-unit sigmoid layer for binary defect detection
- **Dropout Layers**: Regularization (0.3 probability) to prevent overfitting
- **Intermediate Dense Layers**: 256 and 128 units for task-specific feature transformation

### 4.4 Implementation Details

```python
def build_model(input_shape, num_categories):
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    
    # Shared backbone
    x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
    
    # Feature extraction
    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    x = layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.Dropout(0.5)(x)
    
    # Category head
    category_branch = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
    category_branch = layers.Dropout(0.3)(category_branch)
    category_output = layers.Dense(num_categories, activation='softmax', name='category')(category_branch)
    
    # Defect head
    defect_branch = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
    defect_branch = layers.Dropout(0.3)(defect_branch)
    defect_output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='defect')(defect_branch)
    
    return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[category_output, defect_output])
```

## 5. Training Methodology

### 5.1 Loss Function Design

We implemented a multi-task loss function with weighted contributions:

```python
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss={
        'category': 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
        'defect': 'binary_crossentropy'
    },
    loss_weights={'category': 1.0, 'defect': 2.0},
    metrics={
        'category': 'accuracy',
        'defect': ['accuracy', tf.keras.metrics.AUC(name='auc')]
    }
)
```

Key design decisions:
- **Category Loss**: Sparse categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification
- **Defect Loss**: Binary crossentropy for anomaly detection
- **Loss Weighting**: Defect detection weighted higher (2.0) to prioritize this critical task
- **Metrics**: Accuracy and AUC for comprehensive performance assessment

### 5.2 Optimization Strategy

We employed the Adam optimizer with default parameters:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 (default)
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adam's adaptive learning rate mechanism
- **Momentum Terms**: β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999 (default)
- **Numerical Stability**: ε=1e-7 (default)

### 5.3 Regularization Techniques

Multiple regularization strategies prevented overfitting:
- **Dropout**: 0.3-0.5 probability in dense layers
- **Early Stopping**: Monitored validation loss with patience=5
- **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations during training
- **Batch Normalization**: Implicit normalization through batch processing

### 5.4 Training Configuration

```python
# Training configuration
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 20

# Callbacks
callbacks = [
    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
        monitor='val_loss',
        patience=5,
        restore_best_weights=True
    ),
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        'best_model.h5',
        monitor='val_defect_auc',
        mode='max',
        save_best_only=True
    ),
    tf.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger('training_log.csv')
]

# Model training
history = model.fit(
    train_ds,
    validation_data=val_ds,
    epochs=EPOCHS,
    callbacks=callbacks,
    verbose=1
)
```

### 5.5 Training Dynamics

We monitored several key aspects during training:
- **Loss Convergence**: Both training and validation loss curves
- **Task Performance**: Separate accuracy metrics for each task
- **Generalization Gap**: Difference between training and validation performance
- **Early Stopping**: Prevented overfitting by halting when validation loss plateaued

## 6. Evaluation Framework

### 6.1 Performance Metrics

We employed a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics:

#### 6.1.1 Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions among total predictions
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among positive predictions
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

#### 6.1.2 Defect Detection Metrics
- **Binary Accuracy**: Proportion of correct defect/non-defect predictions
- **AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- **Confusion Matrix**: Tabular visualization of prediction performance

### 6.2 Evaluation Scripts

We developed specialized evaluation scripts for different analysis aspects:

#### 6.2.1 Basic Performance Evaluation

```python
# Calculate metrics
cat_accuracy = np.mean(np.array(y_pred_cat) == np.array(y_true_cat))
cat_precision, cat_recall, cat_f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(
    y_true_cat, y_pred_cat, average='weighted', zero_division=0
)

def_accuracy = np.mean(np.array(y_pred_def) == np.array(y_true_def))
def_precision, def_recall, def_f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(
    y_true_def, y_pred_def, average='binary', zero_division=0
)
```

#### 6.2.2 Confusion Matrix Visualization

```python
# Plot confusion matrices
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 8))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.heatmap(cat_cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', 
            xticklabels=categories, yticklabels=categories)
plt.title('Category Confusion Matrix')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.heatmap(def_cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Greens', 
            xticklabels=defect_classes, yticklabels=defect_classes)
plt.title('Defect Confusion Matrix')
```

#### 6.2.3 Training Dynamics Analysis

```python
# Plot loss curves
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history_df['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history_df['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Model Loss')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history_df['category_accuracy'], label='Category Accuracy')
plt.plot(history_df['defect_accuracy'], label='Defect Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
```

### 6.3 Feature Space Analysis (t-SNE)

We implemented t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to visualize high-dimensional feature representations:

```python
# Feature extraction
feature_model = Model(
    inputs=model.inputs,
    outputs=model.get_layer(feature_layer_name).output
)

# Apply t-SNE
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42, perplexity=30, n_iter=1000)
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(features)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.scatterplot(
    x='tsne-1', y='tsne-2',
    hue='category',
    data=tsne_df,
    legend="full",
    alpha=0.7
)
```

This analysis revealed:
- **Cluster Separation**: Distinct groupings for different object categories
- **Defect Distribution**: How defective samples position relative to normal ones
- **Feature Space Quality**: Compactness and separation of learned representations

### 6.4 Explainability Analysis (Grad-CAM)

We implemented Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize model attention:

```python
# Create gradient model
grad_model = Model(
    inputs=model.inputs,
    outputs=[model.get_layer(last_conv_layer).output, model.get_layer('defect').output]
)

# Generate heatmaps
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    conv_outputs, predictions = grad_model(img_array)
    grads = tape.gradient(predictions, conv_outputs)
```

Grad-CAM visualizations:
- **Attention Localization**: Showed where the model focuses when making predictions
- **Defect Highlighting**: Confirmed the model attends to actual defect regions
- **Interpretability**: Provided insights into model decision-making processes

## 7. Results and Analysis
